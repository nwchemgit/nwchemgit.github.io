## We excite the system with a quasi-monochromatic
## (Gaussian-enveloped) z-polarized E-field tuned to a transition at
## 10.25 eV.  The envelope takes the form:
##
## G(t) = exp(-(t-t0)^ / 2s^2)
##
## The target excitation has an energy (frequency) of w = 0.3768 au
## and thus an oscillation period of T = 2 pi / w = 16.68 au
##
## Since we are doing a Gaussian envelope in time, we will get a
## Gaussian envelope in frequency (Gaussians are eigenfunctions of a
## Fourier transform), with width equal to the inverse of the width in
## time.  Say, we want a Gaussian in frequency with FWHM = 1 eV
## (recall FWHM = 2 sqrt (2ln2) s_freq) we want an s_freq = 0.42 eV =
## 0.0154 au, thus in time we need s_time = 1 / s_time = 64.8 au.
##
## Now we want the envelope to be effectively zero at t=0, say 1e-8
## (otherwise we get "windowing" effects).  Reordering G(t):
##
## t0 = t - sqrt(-2 s^2 ln G(t))
##
## That means our Gaussian needs to be centered at t0 = 393.3 au.
##
## The total simulation time will be 1000 au to leave lots of time to
## see oscillations after the field has passed.
