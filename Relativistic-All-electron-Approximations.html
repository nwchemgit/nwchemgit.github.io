<p>All methods which include treatment of relativistic effects are
ultimately based on the Dirac equation, which has a four component wave
function. The solutions to the Dirac equation describe both positrons
(the &ldquo;negative energy&rdquo; states) and electrons (the &ldquo;positive energy&rdquo;
states), as well as both spin orientations, hence the four components.
The wave function may be broken down into two-component functions
traditionally known as the large and small components; these may further
be broken down into the spin components.</p>
<p>The implementation of approximate all-electron relativistic methods in
quantum chemical codes requires the removal of the negative energy
states and the factoring out of the spin-free terms. Both of these may
be achieved using a transformation of the Dirac Hamiltonian known in
general as a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. Unfortunately this
transformation cannot be represented in closed form for a general
potential, and must be approximated. One popular approach is that
originally formulated by Douglas and Kroll<sup id="fnref_footnote_1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_1">1</a></sup> and developed by
Hess<sup id="fnref_footnote_2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_2">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_3">3</a></sup>. This approach decouples the positive and negative energy
parts to second order in the external potential (and also fourth order
in the fine structure constant, α). Other approaches include the Zeroth
Order Regular Approximation (ZORA)<sup id="fnref_footnote_4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_4">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_5">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_6">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_7">7</a></sup> and modification
of the Dirac equation by Dyall<sup id="fnref_footnote_8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_8">8</a></sup>, and involves an exact FW
transformation on the atomic basis set level<sup id="fnref_footnote_9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_9">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_10">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since these approximations only modify the integrals, they can in
principle be used at all levels of theory. At present the Douglas-Kroll
and ZORA implementations can be used at all levels of theory whereas
Dyall&rsquo;s approach is currently available at the Hartree-Fock level. The
derivatives have been implemented, allowing both methods to be used in
geometry optimizations and frequency calculations.</p>
<p>The RELATIVISTIC directive provides input for the implemented
relativistic approximations and is a compound directive that encloses
additional directives specific to the
approximations:</p>
<pre><code>RELATIVISTIC
  [DOUGLAS-KROLL [&lt;string (ON||OFF) default ON&gt; \  
                &lt;string (FPP||DKH||DKFULL||DK3||DK3FULL) default DKH&gt;]  || 
   ZORA [ (ON || OFF) default ON ] ||   
   DYALL-MOD-DIRAC [ (ON || OFF) default ON ]   
                 [ (NESC1E || NESC2E) default NESC1E ] ]  
  [CLIGHT &lt;real clight default 137.0359895&gt;]  
 END
</code></pre>
<p>Only one of the methods may be chosen at a time. If both methods are
found to be on in the input block, NWChem will stop and print an error
message. There is one general option for both methods, the definition of
the speed of light in atomic units:</p>
<pre><code> CLIGHT &lt;real clight default 137.0359895&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The following sections describe the optional sub-directives that can be
specified within the RELATIVISTIC block.</p>
<h2 id="douglas-kroll-approximation">Douglas-Kroll approximation<a class="headerlink" href="#douglas-kroll-approximation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The spin-free and spin-orbit one-electron Douglas-Kroll approximation
have been implemented. The use of relativistic effects from this
Douglas-Kroll approximation can be invoked by specifying:</p>
<pre><code> DOUGLAS-KROLL [&lt;string (ON||OFF) default ON&gt; \ 
                &lt;string (FPP||DKH||DKFULL|DK3|DK3FULL) default DKH&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>The ON|OFF string is used to turn on or off the Douglas-Kroll
approximation. By default, if the DOUGLAS-KROLL keyword is found, the
approximation will be used in the calculation. If the user wishes to
calculate a non-relativistic quantity after turning on Douglas-Kroll,
the user will need to define a new RELATIVISTIC block and turn the
approximation OFF. The user could also simply put a blank RELATIVISTIC
block in the input file and all options will be turned off.</p>
<p>The FPP is the approximation based on free-particle projection
operators<sup id="fnref_footnote_11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_11">11</a></sup> whereas the DKH and DKFULL approximations are based on
external-field projection operators<sup id="fnref_footnote_12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_12">12</a></sup>. The latter two are
considerably better approximations than the former. DKH is the
Douglas-Kroll-Hess approach and is the approach that is generally
implemented in quantum chemistry codes. DKFULL includes certain
cross-product integral terms ignored in the DKH approach (see for
example Häberlen and Rösch<sup id="fnref_footnote_13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_13">13</a></sup>). The third-order Douglas-Kroll
approximation has been implemented by T. Nakajima and K.
Hirao<sup id="fnref_footnote_14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_14">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref_footnote_15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn_footnote_15">15</a></sup>. This approximation can be called using DK3 (DK3
without cross-product integral terms) or DK3FULL (DK3 with cross-product
integral terms).</p>
<p>The contracted basis sets used in the calculations should reflect the
relativistic effects, i.e. one should use contracted basis sets which
were generated using the Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian. Basis sets that were
contracted using the non-relativistic (Schödinger) Hamiltonian WILL
PRODUCE ERRONEOUS RESULTS for elements beyond the first row. See
appendix A for available basis sets and their naming convention.</p>
<p>NOTE: we suggest that spherical basis sets are used in the calculation.
The use of high quality cartesian basis sets can lead to numerical
inaccuracies.</p>
<p>In order to compute the integrals needed for the Douglas-Kroll
approximation the implementation makes use of a fitting basis set (see
literature given above for details). The current code will create this
fitting basis set based on the given &ldquo;ao basis&rdquo; by simply uncontracting
that basis. This again is what is commonly implemented in quantum
chemistry codes that include the Douglas-Kroll method. Additional
flexibility is available to the user by explicitly specifying a
Douglas-Kroll fitting basis set. This basis set must be named &ldquo;D-K
basis&rdquo; (see <a href="Basis.html">Basis Sets</a>).</p>
<h2 id="zeroth-order-regular-approximation-zora">Zeroth Order regular approximation (ZORA)<a class="headerlink" href="#zeroth-order-regular-approximation-zora" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The spin-free and spin-orbit one-electron zeroth-order regular
approximation (ZORA) have been implemented. ZORA can be accessed only 
via the DFT and SO-DFT modules. The use of relativistic
effects with ZORA can be invoked by specifying:</p>
<pre><code> ZORA [&lt;string (ON||OFF) default ON&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The ON|OFF string is used to turn on or off ZORA. By default, if the
ZORA keyword is found, the approximation will be used in the
calculation. If the user wishes to calculate a non-relativistic quantity
after turning on ZORA, the user will need to define a new RELATIVISTIC
block and turn the approximation OFF. The user can also simply put a
blank RELATIVISTIC block in the input file and all options will be
turned off.</p>
<p>To increase the accuracy of ZORA calculations, the following settings may be used 
in the relativistic block</p>
<pre><code> relativistic
     zora on
     zora:cutoff 1d-30
 end
</code></pre>
<p>To invoke the relativistic ZORA model potential approach due to van Wullen (references 16 &amp; 17).</p>
<p>For model potentials constructed from 4-component densities:  </p>
<pre><code> relativistic
     zora on
     zora:cutoff 1d-30
     modelpotential  1
 end
</code></pre>
<p>For model potentials constructed from 2-component densities:  </p>
<pre><code> relativistic
     zora on
     zora:cutoff 1d-30
     modelpotential  2
 end
</code></pre>
<p>Both approaches are comparable in accuracy and depends on the system.</p>
<h2 id="dyalls-modified-dirac-hamitonian-approximation">Dyall&rsquo;s Modified Dirac Hamitonian approximation<a class="headerlink" href="#dyalls-modified-dirac-hamitonian-approximation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The approximate methods described in this section are all based on
Dyall&rsquo;s modified Dirac Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is entirely
equivalent to the original Dirac Hamiltonian, and its solutions have the
same properties. The modification is achieved by a transformation on the
small component, extracting out &sigma;&sdot;<strong>p</strong>/2mc. This
gives the modified small component the same symmetry as the large
component, and in fact it differs from the large component only at order &alpha;<sup>2</sup>. The advantage of the modification is that the operators
now resemble the operators of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian, and can be
classified in a similar fashion into spin-free, spin-orbit and spin-spin
terms. It is the spin-free terms which have been implemented in NWChem,
with a number of further approximations.</p>
<p>The first is that the negative energy states are removed by a normalized
elimination of the small component (NESC), which is equivalent to an
exact Foldy-Wouthuysen (EFW) transformation. The number of components in
the wave function is thereby effectively reduced from 4 to 2. NESC on
its own does not provide any advantages, and in fact complicates things
because the transformation is energy-dependent. The second approximation
therefore performs the elimination on an atom-by-atom basis, which is
equivalent to neglecting blocks which couple different atoms in the EFW
transformation. The advantage of this approximation is that all the
energy dependence can be included in the contraction coefficients of the
basis set. The tests which have been done show that this approximation
gives results well within chemical accuracy. The third approximation
neglects the commutator of the EFW transformation with the two-electron
Coulomb interaction, so that the only corrections that need to be made
are in the one-electron integrals. This is the equivalent of the
Douglas-Kroll(-Hess) approximation as it is usually applied.</p>
<p>The use of these approximations can be invoked with the use of the
DYALL-MOD-DIRAC directive in the RELATIVISTIC directive block. The
syntax is as follows.</p>
<pre><code> DYALL-MOD-DIRAC [ (ON || OFF) default ON ] 
                 [ (NESC1E || NESC2E) default NESC1E ]
</code></pre>
<p>The ON|OFF string is used to turn on or off the Dyall&rsquo;s modified Dirac
approximation. By default, if the DYALL-MOD-DIRAC keyword is found, the
approximation will be used in the calculation. If the user wishes to
calculate a non-relativistic quantity after turning on Dyall&rsquo;s modified
Dirac, the user will need to define a new RELATIVISTIC block and turn
the approximation OFF. The user could also simply put a blank
RELATIVISTIC block in the input file and all options will be turned off.</p>
<p>Both one- and two-electron approximations are available NESC1E ||
NESC2E, and both have analytic gradients. The one-electron approximation
is the default. The two-electron approximation specified by NESC2E has
some sub options which are placed on the same logical line as the
DYALL-MOD-DIRAC directive, with the following
syntax:</p>
<pre><code> NESC2E [ (SS1CENT [ (ON || OFF) default ON ] || SSALL) default SSALL ]
        [ (SSSS [ (ON || OFF) default ON ] || NOSSSS) default SSSS ]
</code></pre>
<p>The first sub-option gives the capability to limit the two-electron
corrections to those in which the small components in any density must
be on the same center. This reduces the <em>(LL|SS)</em> contributions
to at most three-center integrals and the <em>(SS|SS)</em> contributions
to two centers. For a case with only one relativistic atom this option
is redundant. The second controls the inclusion of the <em>(SS|SS)</em>
integrals which are of order &alpha;<sup>4</sup>. For light atoms they may
safely be neglected, but for heavy atoms they should be included.</p>
<p>In addition to the selection of this keyword in the RELATIVISTIC
directive block, it is necessary to supply basis sets in addition to the
ao basis. For the one-electron approximation, three basis sets are
needed: the atomic FW basis set, the large component basis set and the
small component basis set. The atomic FW basis set should be included in
the ao basis. The large and small components should similarly be
incorporated in basis sets named large component and small component,
respectively. For the two-electron approximation, only two basis sets
are needed. These are the large component and the small component. The
large component should be included in the ao basis and the small
component is specified separately as small component, as for the
one-electron approximation. This means that the two approximations can
not be run correctly without changing the ao basis, and it is up to the
user to ensure that the basis sets are correctly specified.</p>
<p>There is one further requirement in the specification of the basis sets.
In the ao basis, it is necessary to add the rel keyword either to the
basis directive or the library tag line (See below for examples). The
former marks the basis functions specified by the tag as relativistic,
the latter marks the whole basis as relativistic. The marking is
actually done at the unique shell level, so that it is possible not only
to have relativistic and nonrelativistic atoms, it is also possible to
have relativistic and nonrelativistic shells on a given atom. This would
be useful, for example, for diffuse functions or for high angular
momentum correlating functions, where the influence of relativity was
small. The marking of shells as relativistic is necessary to set up a
mapping between the ao basis and the large and/or small component basis
sets. For the one-electron approximation the large and small component
basis sets MUST be of the same size and construction, i.e. differing
only in the contraction coefficients.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the relativistic code will NOT work with
basis sets that contain sp shells, nor will it work with ECPs. Both of
these are tested and flagged as an error.</p>
<p>Some examples follow. The first example sets up the data for
relativistic calculations on water with the one-electron approximation
and the two-electron approximation, using the library basis sets.</p>
