<p>The Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE) Module of NWChem implements a
variety of approximations that converge at the exact solutions of
Schr√∂dinger equation. They include configuration interaction theory
through singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples substitutions,
coupled-cluster theory through connected singles, doubles, triples, and
quadruples substitutions, and many-body perturbation theory through
fourth order in its tensor formulation. Not only optimized parallel
programs of some of these high-end correlation theories are new, but
also the way in which they have been developed is unique. The working
equations of all of these methods have been derived completely
automatically by a symbolic manipulation program called a Tensor
Contraction Engine (TCE), and the optimized parallel programs have also
been computer-generated by the same program, which were interfaced to
NWChem. The development of the TCE program and this portion of the
NWChem program has been financially supported by the United States
Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science,
through the SciDAC program.</p>
<p>The capabilities of the module include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restricted Hartree-Fock, unrestricted Hartree-Fock, and restricted
    open-shell Hartree-Fock references,</li>
<li>Restricted KS DFT and unrestricted KS DFT references,</li>
<li>Unrestricted configuration interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, and
    CISDTQ),</li>
<li>Unrestricted coupled-cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD,
    CCSDT, CCSDTQ),</li>
<li>Unrestricted iterative many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2),
    MBPT(3), MBPT(4)] in its tensor formulation,</li>
<li>Unrestricted coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative
    connected triples {CCSD(T), CCSD[T]},</li>
<li>Unrestricted equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory (EOM-CCSD,
    EOM-CCSDT, EOM-CCSDTQ) for excitation energies, transition moments
    and oscillator strengths, and excited-state dipole moments,</li>
<li>Unrestricted coupled-cluster theory (CCSD, CCSDT, CCSDTQ) for dipole
    moments.</li>
<li>Several variants of active-space CCSDt and EOMCCSDt methods that
    employ limited set of triply excited cluster amplitudes defined by
    active orbitals.</li>
<li>Ground-state non-iterative CC approaches that account for the effect
    of triply and/or quadruply excited connected clusters: the
    perturbative approaches based on the similarity transformed
    Hamiltonian: CCSD(2), CCSD(2)<sub>T</sub>, CCSDT(2)<sub>Q</sub>, the
    completely and locally renormalized methods: CR-CCSD(T), LR-CCSD(T),
    LR-CCSD(TQ)-1.</li>
<li>Excited-state non-iterative corrections due to triples to the
    EOMCCSD excitation energies: the completely renormalized EOMCCSD(T)
    method (CR-EOMCCSD(T)).</li>
<li>Dynamic dipole polarizabilities at the CCSD and CCSDT levels using
    the linear response formalism.</li>
<li>Ground- and excited- states the iterative second-order model CC2.</li>
<li>Dynamic dipole polarizabilities at the CCSDTQ level using the linear
    response formalism.</li>
<li>State-specific Multireference Coupled Cluster methods (MRCC)
    (Brillouin-Wigner (BW-MRCC) and Mukherjee (Mk-MRCC) approaches).</li>
<li>Universally State Selective corrections to the BW-MRCC and Mk-MRCC methods 
    (diagonal USS(2) and perturbative USS(pt) methods).</li>
<li>Electron affinity/Ionization potential EOMCCSD formulations
    (EA/IP-EOMCC; available for RHF reference only).</li>
</ul>
<p>The distributed binary executables do not contain CCSDTQ and its
derivative methods, owing to their large volume. The source code
includes them, so a user can reinstate them by setenv CCSDTQ yes and
recompile TCE module. The following optimizations have been used in the
module:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spin symmetry (spin integration is performed wherever possible
    within the unrestricted framework, making the present unrestricted
    program optimal for an open-shell system. The spin adaption was not
    performed, although in a restricted calculation for a closed-shell
    system, certain spin blocks of integrals and amplitudes are further
    omitted by symmetry, and consequently, the present unrestricted CCSD
    requires only twice as many operations as a spin-adapted restricted
    CCSD for a closed-shell system),</li>
<li>Point-group symmetry,</li>
<li>Index permutation symmetry,</li>
<li>Runtime orbital range tiling for memory management,</li>
<li>Dynamic load balancing (local index sort and matrix multiplications)
    parallelism,</li>
<li>Multiple parallel I/O schemes including fully in-core algorithm
    using Global Arrays,</li>
<li>Frozen core and virtual approximation.</li>
<li>DIIS extrapolation and Jacobi update of excitation amplitudes</li>
<li>Additional algorithms for the 2-e integral transformation, including
    efficient and scalable spin-free out-of-core N<sup>5</sup> algorithms.</li>
<li>Hybrid I/O schemes for both spin-orbital and spin-free calculations
    which eliminate the memory bottleneck of the 2-e integrals in favor
    of disk storage. Calculations with nearly 400 basis functions at the
    CCSD(T) can be performed on workstation using this method.</li>
<li>Parallel check-pointing and restart for ground-state (including
    property) calculations at the CCSD, CCSDT and CCSDTQ levels of
    theory.</li>

<p>The TCE thoroughly analyzes the working equation of many-electron theory
models and automatically generates a program that takes full advantage
of these symmetries at the same time. To do so, the TCE first recognizes
the index permutation symmetries among the working equations, and
perform strength reduction and factorization by carefully monitoring the
index permutation symmetries of intermediate tensors. Accordingly, every
input and output tensor (such as integrals, excitation amplitudes,
residuals) has just two independent but strictly ordered index strings,
and each intermediate tensor has just four independent but strictly
ordered index strings. The operation cost and storage size of tensor
contraction is minimized by using the index range restriction arising
from these index permutation symmetries and also spin and spatial
symmetry integration.</p>
<h3 id="runtime-orbital-range-tiling">Runtime orbital range tiling<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-orbital-range-tiling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>To maintain the peak local memory usage at a manageable level, in the
beginning of the calculation, the orbitals are rearranged into tiles
(blocks) that contains orbitals with the same spin and spatial
symmetries. So the tensor contractions in these methods are carried out
at the tile level; the spin, spatial, and index permutation symmetry is
employed to reduce the operation and storage cost at the tile level
also. The so-called tile-structure of all tensors used in CC equations
is also the key-factor determining the parallel structure of the TCE CC
codes . The tiling scheme corresponds to partitioning of the
spin-orbital domain into smaller subsets containing the spin-orbitals of
the same spin and spatial symmetries (the so-called tiles). This
partitioning of the spin-orbital domain entails the blocking of all
tensors corresponding to one- and two-electron integrals, cluster
amplitudes, and all recursive intermediates, into smaller blocks of the
size defined by the size of the tile (or tilesize for short). Since the
parallel scheme used in all TCE generated codes is deeply rooted in
dynamic load balancing techniques, the tile-structure defines the
granularity of the work to be distributed. The size of tiles (tilesize)
defines also the local memory requirements in all TCE derived CC
implementations. For CI/CC/EOMCC/LR-CC models based on the sinlges and
doubles models (CISD,CCSD,EOMCCSD,LR-CCSD) the peak local memory
requirement is proportional to the <img alt="$(tilesize)^{4}$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/64683788b224dc948aaa3b65bddf1565.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="72.940725pt" height="26.70657pt"/>. In approaches
accounting for triples, either in iterative or non-iterative fashion,
the local memory usage is proportional to <img alt="$(tilesize)^{6}$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/4927230b0a05b93323c6d48999745879.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="72.940725pt" height="26.70657pt"/>. This means
that in the CCSD(T), CCSDt, CCSDT, CR-EOMCCSD(T), EOMCCSDt, EOMCCSDT,
LR-CCSDT caluclations the tilesize cannot be defined too large.</p>

<p>Each process is assigned a local tensor index sorting and tensor
contraction dynamically. It must first retrieve the tiles of input
tensors, and perform these local operations, and accumulate the output
tensors to the storage. We have developed a uniform interface for these
I/O operations to either (1) a global file on a global file system, (2)
a global memory on a global or distributed memory system, and (3)
semi-replicated files on a distributed file systems. Some of these
operations depend on the ParSoft library.</p>

<p>All of these models are based on spin-orbital expressions of the
amplitude and energy equations, and designed primarily for
spin-unrestricted reference wave functions. However, for a restricted
reference wave function of a closed-shell system, some further reduction
of operation and storage cost will be made. Within the unrestricted
framework, all these methods take full advantage of spin, spatial, and
index permutation symmetries to save operation and storage costs at
every stage of the calculation. Consequently, these computer-generated
programs will perform significantly faster than, for instance, a
hand-written spin-adapted CCSD program in NWChem, although the nominal
operation cost for a spin-adapted CCSD is just one half of that for
spin-unrestricted CCSD (in spin-unrestricted CCSD there are three
independent sets of excitation amplitudes, whereas in spin-adapted CCSD
there is only one set, so the nominal operation cost for the latter is
one third of that of the former. For a restricted reference wave
function of a closed-shell system, all Œ≤ spin block of the excitation
amplitudes and integrals can be trivially mapped to the all Œ± spin
block, reducing the ratio to one half).</p>
<p>While the MBPT (MP) models implemented in the TCE module give identical
correlation energies as conventional implementation for a canonical HF
reference of a closed-shell system, the former are intrinsically more
general and theoretically robust for other less standard reference wave
functions and open-shell systems. This is because the zeroth order of
Hamiltonian is chosen to be the full Fock operator (not just the
diagonal part), and no further approximation was invoked. So unlike the
conventional implementation where the Fock matrix is assumed to be
diagonal and a correlation energy is evaluated in a single analytical
formula that involves orbital energies (or diagonal Fock matrix
elements), the present tensor MBPT requires the iterative solution of
amplitude equations and subsequent energy evaluation and is generally
more expensive than the former. For example, the operation cost of many
conventional implementation of MBPT(2) scales as the fourth power of the
system size, but the cost of the present tensor MBPT(2) scales as the
fifth power of the system size, as the latter permits non-canonical HF
reference and the former does not (to reinstate the non-canonical HF
reference in the former makes it also scale as the fifth power of the
system size).</p>
<h3 id="state-specific-multireference-coupled-cluster-methods-mrcc">State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster methods (MRCC)<a class="headerlink" href="#state-specific-multireference-coupled-cluster-methods-mrcc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Several State-Specific MRCC methods have been implemented in 6.3 release
of nwchem. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterative Brillouin-Wigner MRCC method employing single and double
    excitations (BW-MRCCSD)</li>
<li>Iterative Mukherjee MRCC method employing single and double
    excitations (Mk-MRCCSD)</li>
<li>Non-iterative methods accounting for triple excitations in MRCC
    formalisms: BW-MRCCSD(T) and Mk-MRCCSD(T)</li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation can be used in studies of systems composed of
an even number of correlated electrons (this limitation will be removed
in the next release). This includes typical examples of diradical,
open-shell singlets, and bond-forming/breaking processes where the
corresponding wavefunctions have strong quasidegenerate character.</p>
<p>To enable the compilation of the MRCC codes one has to set the following
variable before the compilation of NWChem</p>
<pre><code> export MRCC_METHODS=y
</code></pre>

<p>To run MRCC calculations the user has to define two groups in the input
file. First, the TCE group and secondly the MRCCDATA group. In the TCE
group the iterative level of theory is defined, e.g. BWCCSD or MKCCSD.
This implementation was designed for complete model spaces (CMS) which
means that the modelspace contains all Slater determinants of all
possible (in the context of the spatial and spin symmetry, M_s)
distributions of active electrons among active spin orbitals. The user
can define the modelspace in two ways. As a first approach the model
space can be defined by hand, as shown in the two examples below. The
input of the model space starts with the &ldquo;NREF&rdquo; keyword followed by the
number of reference configurations that will be used, which should equal
the number of strings for references below. In the input &ldquo;2&rdquo; refers to
doubly occupied orbitals, &ldquo;a&rdquo; to alpha electrons, &ldquo;b&rdquo; to beta electrons
and &ldquo;0&rdquo; identifies an unoccupied orbital. When the model space is
defined by hand the occupation strings have to include the frozen
orbitals as well. In the second way the CMS can be generated using the
keyword &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; followed by the number of active electrons and the number
of active orbitals. When using the &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; keyword we strongly recommend
that users check the references that are generated.</p>
<p>As the model space typically includes multiple configurations it is
possible to use the MRCC method to calculate excited states instead of
the ground state. For this reason it is required to specify the root of
interest. The ROOT keyword followed by the root number specifies the
state the code calculates. The lowest root, the ground state, is
identified as root 1. If one wants to calculate the third root the
keyword ROOT 3 should be used. An example is given below.</p>

<p>This version of MRCC works only with GA as specified by the &ldquo;IO GA&rdquo;
option. In addition this code works only with the spin-orbit 4-index
transformation, however in all circumstances an RHF Hartree-Fock initial
calculation has to be used. In this implementation the effective
Hamiltonian operator contains only scalar, one- and two-body many body
components. Finally, in our implementation the BWCCSD methods use the
energy threshold for the convergence, whereas the MKCCSD method uses the
norm of the residual.</p>
<p>In addition to the iterative single-double calculations the code can
calculate non-iterative triples corrections. To request these triples
corrections the keyword &ldquo;SE4T&rdquo; should be added to the MRCCDATA block.
The implementation details and the from of the triples correction are

<p>As in the EOMCCSD input we can request any number of roots.</p>
<p>In analogy to the EOMCC calculations we can customize the number of
initial guesses by using &ldquo;set tce:maxeorb&rdquo; directive. For example for
system with the symmetry with the orbital energy structure shown
below <br />
<img alt="ea ip" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/images/ea-ip-initial-guess.png" align=middle with="336pt" height="412pt"/><br />
one can use the energy window (in the sense of the absolute value of the
HF orbital energies) to pinpoint the initial guesses. If one is
interested in calculating one EA-EOMCCSD root of the a1 symmetry the</p>
<pre><code> set tce:maxeorb 0.1
</code></pre>

<p>should be used. This means that the number of starting vectors will be
equal to the number of the unoccupied a1 symmetry orbitals with the
corresponding orbital energies less than 0.1 (in our example there will
be only one such a vector corresponding to the unoccupied orbital energy
0.072). If one looks for two roots</p>
<pre><code> set tce:maxeorb 0.16
</code></pre>

<p>option should be used(there are two a1 unoccupied orbitals with energies
less than 0.16).</p>
<p>For the IP-EOMCCSD case the &ldquo;set tce:maxeorb&rdquo; option works in a similar
way. For example if one is looks for 1 IP-EOMCCSD root of a1 symmetry ,</p>
<pre><code>set tce:maxeorb 0.24 
</code></pre>

<p>directive should be used (there is only one occupied orbital of a1
symmetry with the absolute value of orbital energy less than 0.24),
etc.</p>

<p>This keyword specifies the convergence threshold of iterative solutions
of amplitude equations, and applies to all of the CI, CC, and MBPT
models. The threshold refers to the norm of residual, namely, the
deviation from the amplitude equations. The default value is 1e-6.</p>

<h3 id="io-parallel-io-scheme">IO &ndash; parallel I/O scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#io-parallel-io-scheme" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are five parallel I/O schemes implemented for all the models,
which need to be wisely chosen for a particular problem and computer
architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>fortran : Fortran77 direct access,</li>
<li>eaf : Exclusive Access File library,</li>
<li>ga : Fully incore, Global Array virtual file,</li>
<li>sf : Shared File library,</li>
<li>replicated : Semi-replicated file on distributed file system with
    EAF library.</li>
<li>dra : Distributed file on distributed file system with DRA library.</li>
<li>ga_eaf : Semi-replicated file on distributed file system with EAF
    library. GA is used to speedup the file reconciliation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GA algorithm, which is default, stores all input (integrals and
excitation amplitudes), output (residuals), and intermediate tensors in
the shared memory area across all nodes by virtue of GA library. This
fully incore algorithm replaces disk I/O by inter-process
communications. This is a recommended algorithm whenever feasible. Note
that the memory management through runtime orbital range tiling
described above applies to local (unshared) memory of each node, which
may be separately allocated from the shared memory space for GA. So when
there is not enough shared memory space (either physically or due to
software limitations, in particular, shmmax setting), the GA algorithm
can crash due to an out-of-memory error. The replicated scheme is the
currently the only disk-based algorithm for a genuinely distributed file
system. This means that each node keeps an identical copy of input
tensors and it holds non-identical overlapping segments of intermediate
and output tensors in its local disk. Whenever data coherency is
required, a file reconcilation process will take place to make the
intermediate and output data identical throughout the nodes. This
algorithm, while requiring redundant data space on local disk, performs
reasonably efficiently in parallel. For sequential execution, this
reduces to the EAF scheme. For a global file system, the SF scheme is
recommended. This together with the Fortran77 direct access scheme does
not usually exhibit scalability unless shared files on the global file
system also share the same I/O buffer. For sequential executions, the
SF, EAF, and replicated schemes are interchangeable, while the Fortran77
scheme is appreciably slower.</p>
<p>Two new I/O algorithms dra and ga_eaf combines GA and DRA or EAF based
replicated algorithm. In the former, arrays that are not active (e.g.,
prior T amplitudes used in DIIS or EOM-CC trial vectors) in GA algorithm
will be moved to DRA. In the latter, the intermediates that are formed
by tensor contractions are initially stored in GA, thereby avoiding the
need to accumulate the fragments of the intermediate scattered in EAFs
in the original EAF algorithm. Once the intermediate is formed
completely, then it will be replicated as EAFs.</p>
<p>The spin-free 4-index transformation algorithms are exclusively
compatible with the GA I/O scheme, although out-of-core algorithms for
the 4-index transformation are accessible using the 2emet options. See
<a href="#2emet-alternative-storage-of-two-electron-integrals">Alternative storage of two-electron

<h3 id="diis-the-convergence-acceleration">DIIS &ndash; the convergence acceleration<a class="headerlink" href="#diis-the-convergence-acceleration" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It sets the number iterations in which a DIIS extrapolation is performed
to accelerate the convergence of excitation amplitudes. The default
value is 5, which means in every five iteration, one DIIS extrapolation
is performed (and in the rest of the iterations, Jacobi rotation is
used). When zero or negative value is specified, the DIIS is turned off.
It is not recommended to perform DIIS every iteration, whereas setting a
large value for this parameter necessitates a large memory (disk) space
to keep the excitation amplitudes of previous iterations. In 5.0 version
we significantly improved the DIIS solver by re-organizing the iterative
process and by introducing the level shift option (lshift) that enable
to increase small orbital energy differences used in calculating the
up-dates for cluster amplitudes. Typical values for lshift oscillates
between 0.3 and 0.5 for CC calculations for ground states of
multi-configurational character. Otherwise, the value of lshift is by
default set equal to 0.</p>

<p>Some of the lowest-lying core orbitals and/or some of the highest-lying

(this does not affect the ground state HF or DFT calculation). No
orbitals are frozen by default. To exclude the atom-like core regions

<h3 id="nroots-the-number-of-excited-states">NROOTS &ndash; the number of excited states<a class="headerlink" href="#nroots-the-number-of-excited-states" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>One can specify the number of excited state roots to be determined. The
default value is 1. It is advised that the users request several more
roots than actually needed, since owing to the nature of the trial
vector algorithm, some low-lying roots can be missed when they do not
have sufficient overlap with the initial guess vectors.</p>
<h3 id="target-and-targetsym-the-target-root-and-its-symmetry">TARGET and TARGETSYM &ndash; the target root and its symmetry<a class="headerlink" href="#target-and-targetsym-the-target-root-and-its-symmetry" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>At the moment, the first and second geometrical derivatives of
excitation energies that are needed in force, geometry, and frequency
calculations are obtained by numerical differentiation. These keywords
may be used to specify which excited state root is being used for the
geometrical derivative calculation. For instance, when TARGET 3 and
TARGETSYM a1g are included in the input block, the total energy (ground
state energy plus excitation energy) of the third lowest excited state
root (excluding the ground state) transforming as the irreducible
representation a1g will be passed to the module which performs the
derivative calculations. The default values of these keywords are 1 and
none, respectively.</p>
<p>The keyword TARGETSYM is essential in excited state geometry
optimization, since it is very common that the order of excited states
changes due to the geometry changes in the course of optimization.
Without specifying the TARGETSYM, the optimizer could (and would likely)
be optimizing the geometry of an excited state that is different from
the one the user had intended to optimize at the starting geometry. On
the other hand, in the frequency calculations, TARGETSYM must be none,
since the finite displacements given in the course of frequency
calculations will lift the spatial symmetry of the equilibrium geometry.
When these finite displacements can alter the order of excited states
including the target state, the frequency calculation is not be
feasible.</p>
<h3 id="symmetry-restricting-the-excited-state-symmetry">SYMMETRY &ndash; restricting the excited state symmetry<a class="headerlink" href="#symmetry-restricting-the-excited-state-symmetry" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>By adding this keyword to the input block, the user can request the
module to seek just the roots of the specified irreducible
representation as TARGETSYM. By default, this option is not set.
TARGETSYM must be specified when SYMMETRY is
invoked.</p>
<h3 id="eomsol-alternative-solver-for-the-right-eomccsd-eigenvalue-problem">EOMSOL &ndash; alternative solver for the right EOMCCSD eigenvalue problem<a class="headerlink" href="#eomsol-alternative-solver-for-the-right-eomccsd-eigenvalue-problem" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The EOMSOL enables the user to switch between two algorithms for solving
EOMCCSD eigenproblem. When EOMSOL is set equal to 1 (&ldquo;eomsol 1&rdquo;
directive in the tce group) the old solver is invoked. The advantage of
this solver is a possibility of finding states of complicated
configurational structure, for example doubly excited states. However,
the dimension of the iterative space increases with each iteration and
in effect this algorithm requires large memory allocations especially
for large systems. In order to address this bottleneck, new algorithm
(&ldquo;eomsol 2&rdquo; directive in the tce group) was designed. In EOMSOL 2
algorithm all iterations are split into microcycles corresponding to
diis microiterations (the use of &ldquo;diis&rdquo; parameter is discussed earlier).
This algorithm enables the user to precisely estimate the memory usage
in the EOMCCSD calculations, which is equal to
diis*nroots*(size_x1+size_x2), where diis is the length of the DIIS
cycle, nroots is the number of sought roots, size_x1 corresponds to the
size of GA storing singly excited EOMCC almplitudes, and size_x2 is the
size of GA with doubly excited EOMCC amplitudes. Generally, larger
values of diis parameter lead to a faster convergence, however, this
happens at the expense of larger memory requirements. It is recommended
not to use in the EOMCCSD calculations with &ldquo;eomsol 2&rdquo; diis parameter
smaller than 5, which is its default value. The EOMSOL 2 algorithm uses
the CIS vectors as initial guesses, and for this reason is suited mainly
to track singly excited states. By default, the EOMSOL 1 option is
called in the EOMCCSD calculations. It should be also stressed that all
iterative EOMCC methods with higher than double excitations use EOMSOL 1
approach.</p>
<p>In some situations it is convenient to use separate convergence
threshold for the CCSD and EOMCCSD solvers. This can be achieved by
setting proper environmetal variables. In the following example</p>
<pre><code>geometry/basis set specifications
tce 
 thresh 1.0d-6
 ccsd
 nroots 2
end
set tce:thresheom 1.0d-4
task tce energy
</code></pre>

<p>the CCSD equations will be converged to the 1.0d-6 threshold while the
EOMCCSD ones to 1.0d-4. This option shoul dbe used with the &ldquo;eomsol 2&rdquo;
option. In some situations finding several (n) roots to the EOMCCSD
equations can be quite challenging. To by-pass this problem one can use
the &ldquo;n+1&rdquo; model, i.e., we request another root to be converged. Usually,
the presence the &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; root can imporve the iterative process for n
roots of interest. However, the buffer root does not have to be
converged to the same accuracy as n roots of interest. The follwing
example, shows how to handle this process (we chose n=2, n+1=3):</p>
<pre><code>geometry/basis set specifications
tce 
 freeze core
 ccsd
 nroots 3
 thresh 1.0d-6
end
set tce:thresheom 1.0d-4
set tce:threshl 1.0d-3
task tce energy
</code></pre>

<p>In this example the CCSD equations are solved with the 1.0d-6 threshold,
the first n (2) EOMCCSD roots are determined with the 10d-4 accuracy,
while the buffer root is determined with relax conv. criterion 1.0d-3.</p>
<h3 id="2eorb-alternative-storage-of-two-electron-integrals">2EORB &ndash; alternative storage of two-electron integrals<a class="headerlink" href="#2eorb-alternative-storage-of-two-electron-integrals" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the 5.0 version a new option has been added in order to provide more
economical way of storing two-electron integrals used in CC calculations
based on the RHF and ROHF references. The 2EORB keyword can be used for
all CC methods except for those using an active-space (CCSDt) up to NWChem version 
6.3. After that, further optimization restricted the use of 2EORB to 
CCSD-based methods. Note that the four-index transformation is usually
an insignificant amount of the wall time for methods involving iterative
triples anyway. 
With 2EORB, all two-electron integrals are transformed and subsequently stored in a way
which is compatible with assumed tiling scheme. The transformation from
orbital to spinorbital form of the two-electron integrals is performed
on-the-fly during execution of the CC module. This option, although
slower, allows to significantly reduce the memory requirements needed by
the first half of 4-index transformation and final file with fully
transformed two-electron integrals. Savings in the memory requirements
on the order of magnitude (and more) have been observed for large-scale
open-shell calculations.</p>
<h3 id="2emet-alternative-storage-of-two-electron-integrals">2EMET &ndash; alternative storage of two-electron integrals<a class="headerlink" href="#2emet-alternative-storage-of-two-electron-integrals" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Several new computation-intensive algorithms has been added with the
purpose of improving scalability and overcoming local memory bottleneck
of the 5.0 2EORB 4-index transformation. In order to give the user a
full control over this part of the TCE code several keywords were
designed to define the most vital parameters that determine the
perfromance of 4-index transformation. All new keywords must be used
with the 2EORB keyword, and thus will not work beyond CCSD methods after 
NWChem 6.3 (see explanation for 2EORB above). The 2emet keyword (default 
value 1 or <code>2emet 1</code>, refers to the older 4-index transformation), defines the algorithm to be
used. By putting 2emet 2 the TCE code will execute the algoritm based on
the two step procedure with two intermediate files. In some instances
this algorithm is characterized by better timings compared to algorithms
3 and 4, although it is more memory demanding. In contrast to algorithms
nr 1,3, and 4 this approach can make use of a disk to store intermediate
files. For this purpose one should use the keyword idiskx (idiskx 0
causes that all intermediate files are stored on global arrays, while
idiskx 1 tells the code to use a disk to store intermediates; default
value of idiskx is equal 0). Algorithm nr 3 (2emet 3) uses only one
intermediate file whereas algorithm nr 4 (2emet 4) is a version of
algorithm 3 with the option of reducing the memory requirements. For
example, by using new keyword split 4 we will reduce the size of only
intermediate file by factor of 4 (the split keyword can be only used in
the context of algorithm nr 4). All new algorithms (i.e. 2emet 2+) use
the attilesize setting to define the size of the atomic tile. By default
attilesize is set equal 30. For larger systems the use of larger values
of attilesize is recommended (typically between 40-60).</p>
<p>Additional algorithms are numbered 5, 6 and 9. Other values of 2emet are
not supported and refer to methods which do not function properly.
Algorithms 5 and 6 were written as out-of-core <img alt="$N^5$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/f56fbac61e4cf5d8984f6b2d8b7fbe49.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="21.47871pt" height="26.70657pt"/> methods (idiskx1) and are the most efficient algorithms at the present time. The
corresponding in-core variants (idiskx 0) are available but require
excessive memory with respect to the methods discussed above, although
they may be faster if sufficient memory is available (to get enough
memory often requires excessive nodes, which decreases performance in
the later stages of the calculation). The difference between 5 and 6 is
that 5 writes to a single file (SF or GA) while 6 uses multiple files.
For smaller calculations, particularly single-node jobs, 5 is faster
than 6, but for more than a handful of processors, algorithm 6 should be
used. The perforance discrepancy depends on the hardware used but in
algorithm eliminates simulataneous disk access on parallel file systems
or memory mutexes for the in-core case. For NFS filesystems attached to
parallel clusters, no performance differences have been observed, but
for Lustre and PVFS they are signficant. Using algorithm 5 for large
parallel file systems will make the file system inaccessible to other
users, invoking the wrath of system administrators.</p>
<p>Algorithm 9 is an out-of-core solution to the memory bottleneck of the
2-e integrals. In this approach, the intermediates of the 4-index
transformation as well as the MO integrals are stored in an SF file. As
before, this requires a shared file system. Because algorithm 9 is based
upon algorithm 5, described above, it is not expected to scale. The
primary purpose of algorithm 9 is to make the performance of the NWChem
coupled-cluster codes competive with fast serial codes on workstations.
It succeeds in this purpose when corresponding functionality is
compared. A more scalable version of this algorithm is possible, but the
utility is limited since large parallel computers do not permit the wall
times necessary to use an out-of-core method, which is necessarily
slower than the in-core variant. An extensible solution to these issues
using complex heterogeneous I/O is in development. Restarting with
algorithm 9 is not supported and attempting to use this feature with the
present version may produce meaningless results.</p>
<p>New is the inclusion of multiple 2emet options for the spin-orbital
transformations, which are the default when 2eorb is not set and are
mandatory for UHF and KS references. The are currently three algorithms
1, 2 and 3 available. The numbering scheme does not correspond in any
way to the numbering scheme for the 2eorb case, except that <code>2emet 1</code>
corresponds to the default algorithm present in previous releases, which
uses the user-defined I/O scheme. Algorithm 2 (2emet 2) writes an SF
file for the half-transformed integrals, which is at least an
order-of-magnitude larger than the fully-transformed integrals, but
stores the fully-transformed integrals in core. Thus, once the 4-index
transformation is complete, this algorithm will perform exactly as when
algorithm 1 is used. Unfortuntely, the spin-orbital 2-e
fully-transformed integrals are still quite large and an algorithm
corresponding to 2eorb/2emet=9 is available with 2emet 3. Algorithm 3 is
also limited in its scalability, but it permits relatively large
UHF-based calculations using single workstations for patient users.</p>
<p>In cases where the user has access to both shared and local filesystems
for parallel calculations, the <code>permanent_dir</code> setting refers to the
location of SF files. The file system for <code>scratch_dir</code> will not be used
for any of the 4-index transformation algorithms which are compatible
with <code>io=ga</code>.</p>
<p>Algorithms 13 and 14 are the N<sup>5</sup> variants of algorithms 3 and 4.
They are the most efficient in core GA-based algorithms for the RHF and
ROHF reference functions. Again, two parameters are needed to define the
perfromance of these algorithms: tilesize and attilesize. By default
attilesize is set equal to 40. In all runs tilesize is required to be
less than attilesize (tilesize &lt; attilesize).</p>
<p>New 4-index transformation for RHF/ROHF references (<code>2emet 15</code>) is
available in NWChem 6.5. In contrast to algorithms 13 and 14
inter-processor communication is significantly reduced resulting in much
better performance.</p>
<p>In the later part of this manual several examples illustrate the use of
the newly introduced keywords.</p>
<p>An efficient loop-fused four-index transfromations for RHF and ROHF references can be
enabled by the sequence <code>2eorb/2emet 16</code>.</p>

<h2 id="tce-response-properties">TCE Response Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#tce-response-properties" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Response properties can be calculated within the TCE. Ground-state
dipole polarizabilities can be performed at the CCSD, CCSDT and CCSDTQ
levels of theory. Neither CCSDT-LR nor CCSDTQ-LR are compiled by
default. Like the rest of the TCE, properties can be calculated with
RHF, UHF, ROHF and DFT reference wavefunctions.</p>
<p>Specific details for the implementation of CCSD-LR and CCSDT-LR can be
found in the following papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>J. R. Hammond, M. Valiev, W. A. deJong and K. Kowalski, J. Phys.
    Chem. A, 111, 5492 (2007).</li>
<li>J. R. Hammond, K. Kowalski and W. A. de Jong, J. Chem. Phys., 127,
    144105 (2007).</li>
<li>J. R. Hammond, W. A. de Jong and K. Kowalski , J. Chem. Phys., 128,
    224102 (2008).</li>
</ul>
<p>An appropriate background on coupled-cluster linear response (CC-LR) can
be found in the references of those papers.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The coupled-cluster response codes were generated in the same manner as
the rest of the TCE, thus all previous comments on performance apply
here as well. The improved offsets available in the CCSD and EOM-CCSD
codes is now also available in the CCSD-Œõ and CCSD-LR codes. The
bottleneck for CCSD-LR is the same as EOM-CCSD, likewise for CCSDT-LR
and EOM-CCSDT. The CCSD-LR code has been tested on as many as 1024
processors for systems with more than 2000 spin-orbitals, while the
CCSDT-LR code has been run on as many as 1024 processors. The CCSDTQ-LR
code is not particularly useful due to the extreme memory requirements
of quadruples amplitudes, limited scalability and poor convergence in
the CCSDTQ equations in general.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The input commands for TCE response properties exclusively use set
directives (see <a href="Top-level.html#SET">SET</a>) instead of TCE input
block keywords. There are currently only three commands available:</p>
<pre><code>set tce:lineresp &lt;logical lineresp default: F&gt;
set tce:afreq &lt;double precision afreq(9) default: 0.0&gt; 
set tce:respaxis &lt;logical respaxis(3) default: T T T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The boolean variable lineresp invokes the linear response equations for
the corresponding coupled-cluster method (only CCSD and CCSDT possess
this feature) and evaluates the dipole polarizability. When lineresp is
true, the Œõ-equations will also be solved, so the dipole moment is also
calculated. If no other options are set, the complete dipole
polarizability tensor will be calculated at zero frequency (static). Up
to nine real frequencies can be set; adding more should not crash the
code but it will calculate meaningless quantities. If one desires to
calculate more frequencies at one time, merely change the line double
precision afreq(9) in <code>$NWCHEM_TOP/src/tce/include/tce.fh</code>
appropriately and recompile.</p>
<p>The user can choose to calculate response amplitudes only for certain
axis, either because of redundancy due to symmetry or because of memory
limitations. The boolean vector of length three respaxis is used to
determine whether or not a given set of response amplitudes are
allocated, solved for, and used in the polarizability tensor evaluation.
The logical variables represent the X, Y, Z axes, respectively. If
respaxis is set to T F T, for example, the responses with respect to the
X and Z dipoles will be calculated, and the four (three unique) tensor
components will be evaluated. This feature is also useful for conserving
memory. By calculating only one axis at a time, memory requirements can
be reduced by 25% or more, depending on the number of DIIS vectors
used. Reducing the number of DIIS vectors also reduces the memory
requirements.</p>
<p>It is strongly advised that when calculating polarizabilities at
high-frequencies, that user set the frequencies in increasing order,
preferably starting with zero or other small value. This approach is
computationally efficient (the initial guess for subsequent responses is
the previously converged value) and mitigates starting from a zero
vector for the response amplitudes.</p>

<h3 id="overview_1">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Check-pointing and restart are critical for computational chemistry
applications of any scale, but particularly those done on
supercomputers, or run for an extended period on workstations and
clusters. The TCE supports parallel check-pointing and restart using the
Shared Files (SF) library in the Global Arrays Tools. The SF library
requires that the file system be accessible by every node, so reading
and writing restart files can only be performed on a shared file system.
For workstations, this condition is trivially met. Restart files must be
persistent to be useful, so volatile file systems or those which are
periodicly erased should not be used for check-pointing.</p>
<p>Restart is possible for all ground-state amplitudes (<em>T</em>, Œõ and
<img alt="$T^{(1)}$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/3b975fbba8cc3b82ca7ae5bb0de31de6.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="28.617105pt" height="29.12679pt"/>) but not for excited-state amplitudes, as in an EOM-CC
calculation. The latter functionality is under development.</p>
<p>Restart capability is useful in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total run time is limited, as is the case for most
    supercomputing facilities.</li>
<li>The system is volatile and jobs die randomly.</li>
<li>When doing property calculations which require a large number of
    responses which cannot all be stored in-core simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the present time, restarting the amplitudes during a potential energy
surface scan or numerical geometry optmization/frequency calculation is
not advised due to the phase issue in the molecular orbital
coefficients. If the phase changes, the amplitudes will no longer be a
useful guess and may lead to nonsense results. Expert users may be able
to use restart when the geometry varies using careful choices in the SCF
input by using the &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; and &ldquo;lock&rdquo; options but this use of restart
is not supported.</p>
<p>If SF encounters a failure during restart I/O, the job will fail. The
capability to ignore a subset of failures, such as when saving the
amplitudes prior to convergence, will be available in the future. This
is useful on some large machines when the filesystem is being taxed by
another job and may be appear unavailable at the moment a check-point
write is attempted.</p>
<p>The performance of SF I/O for restart is excellent and the wall time for
reading and writing integrals and amplitudes is negligible, even on a
supercomputer (such systems have very fast parallel file systems in most
cases). The only platform for which restart may cause I/O problems is
BlueGene, due to ratio of compute to I/O nodes (64 on BlueGene/P).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The boolean variables read_integrals and save_integrals control which
integrals are read/saved. The first location is the 1-e integrals, the
second is for the 2-e integrals, and the third is for dipole integrals.
The fourth and fifth positions are reserved for quadrupole and octupole
integrals but this functionality is not available. The read_t, read_l,
read_tr, save_t, save_l and save_tr variables control the
reading/saving of the <img alt="$T$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/2f118ee06d05f3c2d98361d9c30e38ce.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="11.84502pt" height="22.38192pt"/>, Œõ and <img alt="$T^{(1)}$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/3b975fbba8cc3b82ca7ae5bb0de31de6.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="28.617105pt" height="29.12679pt"/> (response) amplitudes.
Restart control on the response amplitudes is implicitly controlled by
the value of respaxis (see above). Requesting amplitudes that are beyond
the scope of a given calculation, such as <img alt="$T_3$" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/nwchemgit/nwchem/svgs/4025cf3981c802483ddf735af283a602.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width="16.09839pt" height="22.38192pt"/> in a CCSD calculation,
does not produce an error as these commands will never be processed.</p>
<p>Attempting to restart with a set of amplitudes without the corresponding
integrals is ill-advised, due to the phase issue discussed above. For
the same reason, one cannot save a subset of the integrals, so if it is
even remotely possible that the dipole moment or polarizabilities will
be desired for a given molecule, the dipole integrals should be saved as
well. It is possible to save the dipole integrals without setting dipole
in the TCE input block; setting save_integrals(3) true is sufficient
for this to occur.</p>
<p>The save_interval variable controls the frequency with which amplitudes
are saved. By default, the amplitudes are saved only when the iterative
process has converged, meaning that if the iterations do not converge in
less than the maximum, one must start the calculation again from
scratch. The solution is to set save_interval to a smaller value, such
as the number of DIIS cycles being used.</p>
<p>The user shall not change the tilesize when reading in saved amplitudes.
The results of this are catastrophic and under no circumstance will this
lead to physically meaningful results. Restart does not work for 2eorb
and 2emet 9; no error will be produced but the results may be
meaningless.</p>

<p>The following are recommended parameters for getting the best
performance and efficiency for common methods on various hardware
configurations. The optimal settings are far from extensible and it is
extremely important that users take care in how they apply these
recommendations. Testing a variety of settings on a simple example is
recommended when optimal settings are desired. Nonetheless, a few
guiding principles will improve the performance of TCE jobs markedly,
including making otherwise impossible jobs possible.</p>
<h3 id="memory-considerations">Memory considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-considerations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The default memory settings for NWChem are not optimal for TCE
calculations. When 2 GB of memory is available per process, the
following settings are close to optimal for CCSD jobs</p>
<pre><code>memory stack 800 mb heap 100 mb global 1000 mb
</code></pre>

<p>for property jobs, which require more amplitudes to be stored, it is
wise to favor the global allocation</p>
<pre><code>memory stack 500 mb heap 100 mb global 1300 mb
</code></pre>

<p>If you get an error for ga_create during the iterative steps, reduce
the number of DIIS vectors. If this error occurs during the four-index
transformation (after d_v2 filesize appears) you need more GA space, a
different 2emet, or more nodes.</p>
<p>The memory requirements for CCSD(T) are quite different because the
triples are generated in local memory. The value of tilesize should not
be larger than 30 in most cases and one should set something similar to
the following</p>
<pre><code>memory stack 1200 mb heap 100 mb global 600 mb
</code></pre>

<p>The local memory requires will be tilesize<sup>N</sup> where N=4 for
CCSD, N=6 for CCSD(T) and CCSDT, and N=8 for CCSDTQ. One should set
tilesize to 16 or less for CCSDT and CCSDTQ, although symmetry will
affect the local memory use significantly. The local memory usage of the
CR-EOMCCSD(T) approach has recently been significantly reduced to the
level of the CCSD(T) approach (2*tilesize<sup>6</sup>).</p>
<h3 id="using-openmp-in-tce">Using OpenMP in TCE<a class="headerlink" href="#using-openmp-in-tce" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>TCE compute kernels are both floating-point and bandwidth intensive,
hence are amenable to multithreading. However, not all TCE kernels
support OpenMP, and therefore performance may be limited by Amdahl&rsquo;s
law. Furthermore, Global Arrays communication is not yet thread-safe and
must be called outside of threaded regions, potentially limiting
performance. However, even partial OpenMP is likely to improve
performance relative to idle cores, in the case where memory limitations
or other considerations (see below for the case of Xeon Phi
coprocessors) force the user to run NWChem on a subset of the available
CPU cores.</p>
<p>Currently, OpenMP threading is available in the following kernels:</p>
<ul>
<li>BLAS (assuming the chosen library supports this).</li>
<li>CCSD(T) and MRCCSD(T) triples kernels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The development version of NWChem (post-6.6) supports OpenMP more
kernels, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>4- and 6-dimensional tensor transposes.</li>
<li>Loop-driven CCSD tensor contractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, NWChem runs best on CPU-only systems without OpenMP
threads. However, modest OpenMP has been found to improve performance of
CCSD(T) jobs. We expect the benefits of OpenMP to be more visible with
time, as NWChem achieves more complete coverage with OpenMP and as
platforms evolve to have more and more cores per node.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-run-large-ccsdeomccsd-calculations">How to run large CCSD/EOMCCSD calculations<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-run-large-ccsdeomccsd-calculations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When running large CCSD or EOMCCSD calculations for large systems
(number of orbitals larger than 400) and using large number of cores it
is recommended to switch to workflow based implementation of
CCSD/EOMCCSD methods.</p>
<p>The original CCSD/EOMCCSD TCE implementations are aggregates of a large
number of subroutines, which calculate either recursive intermediates or
contributions to residual vector. The dimensionalities of the tensors
involved in a given subroutine greatly impact the memory, computation,
and communication characteristics of each subroutine, which can lead to
pronounced problems with load balancing. For example, for the most
computationally intensive part of the CCSD/EOMCCSD approaches associated
with the inclusion of 4-particle integrals, the corresponding task pool
(the number of tasks in a subroutine) can easily be 2 orders of
magnitude larger than the task pool for subroutines calculating one-body
intermediates. To address this problem and improve the scalability of
the CCSD/EOMCCSD implementations, we exploited the dependencies exposed
between the task pools into classes (C) characterized by a collective
task pool. This was done in such a way as to ensure sufficient
parallelism in each class while minimizing the total number of such
classes. This procedure enabled us to reduce the number of
synchronization steps from nearly 80, in the EOMCCSD case, down to 4.
Optimized versions of the CCSD/EOMCCSD codes are enabled once the</p>
<pre><code>set tce:nts T

<p>directive is used in the input file. Compared to the original
CCSD/EOMCCSD implementations the new approaches requires more global
memory. The new CCSD/EOMCCSD implementations provides significant
improvements in the parallel performance and average time per iteration.</p>

<h3 id="scf-options">SCF options<a class="headerlink" href="#scf-options" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For parallel jobs on clusters with poor disk performance on the
filesystem used for scratch_dir, it is a good idea to disable disk IO
during the SCF stage of the calculation. This is done by adding
semidirect memsize N filesize 0, where N is 80% of the stack memory
divided by 8, as the value in this directive is the number of dwords,
rather than bytes. With these settings, if the aggregate memory is
sufficient to store the integrals, the SCF performance will be
excellent, and it will be better than if direct is set in the SCF input
block. If scratch_dir is set to a local disk, then one should use as
much disk as is permissible, controlled by the value of filesize. On
many high-performance computers, filling up the local scratch disk will
crash the node, so one cannot be careless with these settings. In
addition, on many such machines, the shared file system performance is
better than that of the local disk (this is true for many NERSC
systems).</p>
<h3 id="convergence-criteria">Convergence criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#convergence-criteria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It makes no sense to converge a calculation to a precision not relevant
to experiment. However, the relationship between convergence criteria
and calculated quantities is not fully known for some properties. For
example, the effect of the convergence criteria on the polarizability is
significant in some cases. In the case of CN, convergence of
10<sup>-11</sup> is necessary to resolve the polarizability tensor
components to 10<sup>-2</sup>. However, for many systems 10<sup>-7</sup>
convergence is sufficient to get accurate results for all properties. It
is important to calibrate the effect of convergence on property
calculations, particularly for open-shell and post-CCSD methods, on a
modest basis set before relaxing the convergence criteria too much.</p>

<p>The effect on memory use of using the 2eorb keyword is huge. However,
this option can only be used with IO=GA and an RHF/ROHF reference. There
are a number of choices for the integral transformation algorithm when
using spin-free integrals. The fastest algorithm is 2EMET=5, but
significant disk IO is required for this algorithm. One must set
permanent_dir to a fast, shared file system for this algorithm to work.
If disk performance is not good, one should use either 2EMET=3 or
2EMET=4 depending on how much memory is available. If one sees a
ga_create error with 2EMET=3, then switch to algorithm 4 and add split
8 to the TCE input block.</p>

<p>From our experience using the CCSD(T) and MRCCSD(T) TCE modules, we have
determined that the optimal configuration is to use a single Global
Arrays ranks for offloading work to each Xeon Phi card.</p>
<p>On the EMSL cascade system, each node is equipped with two coprocessors,
and NWChem can allocate one GA ranks per coprocessor. In the job
scripts, we recommend spawning just 6 GA ranks for each node, instead of
16 (number that would match the number of physical cores). Therefore, 2
out 6 GA ranks assigned to a particular compute node will offload to the
coprocessors, while the remaining 6 cores while be used for traditional
CPU processing duties. Since during offload the host core is idle, we
can double the number of OpenMP threads for the host
(<code>OMP_NUM_THREADS=4</code>) in order to fill the idle core with work from
another GA rank (4 process with 4 threads each will total 16 threads on
each node).</p>
<p>NWChem itself automatically detects the available coprocessors in the
system and properly partitions them for optimal use, therefore no action
is required other than specifying the number of processes on each node
(using the appropriate mpirun/mpiexec options) and setting the value of
<code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code> as in the example above.</p>
