### EMSL Arrows - An Easier Way to Use NWChem

Are you just learning NWChem and would like to have an easy way to
generate input decks, check your output decks against a large database
of calculations, perform simple thermochemistry calculations, calculate
the NMR and IR spectra of modest size molecule, or just try out NWChem
before installing it? EMSL Arrows scientific service can help. [A Web
API to EMSL Arrows is now available for Alpha testing. Click on this
link.](https://arrows.emsl.pnnl.gov/api) For more information contact

EMSL arrows is a scientific service that uses NWChem and chemical
computational databases to make materials and chemical modeling
accessible via a broad spectrum of digital communications including
posts to web APIs, social networks, and traditional email. Molecular
modeling software has previously been extremely complex, making it
prohibitive to all but experts in the field, yet even experts can
struggle to perform calculations. This service is designed to be used by
experts and non-experts alike. Experts will be able carry out and keep
track of large numbers of complex calculations with diverse levels of
theories present in their workflows. Additionally, due to a streamlined
and easy-to-use input, non-experts will be able to carry out a wide
variety of molecular modeling calculations previously not accessible to
them.

You do not need to be a molecular modeling expert to use EMSL Arrows. It
is very easy to use. You simply email chemical reactions to
arrows@emsl.pnnl.gov and then an email is sent back to you with
thermodynamic, reaction pathway (kinetic), spectroscopy, and other
results. There are currently 42,000+ calculations in the EMSL Arrows
database and it is growing every day. If an EMSL Arrows request requires
a calculation not already in the database, then it will automatically
start the calculation on a small number of freely available computers
and send back the results when finished. More information can be found
at [Arrows](EMSL_Arrows#%22EMSL). We
would like thank the DOD SERDP program and the DOE OS OBER EMSL project
for their support.

### NWChem 6.6 has been released

NWChem team is pleased to announce the 6.6 release. We would like to
express our sincere thanks to all the authors and contributors who made
this release possible. This release includes several new capabilities
and bug fixes. The key features of NWChem 6.6 include:

  - New qmd module
    [AIMD](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:Gaussian_Basis_AIMD)
    (NVT, NVE) for molecular and finite systems. It can be used with all
    Gaussian basis set ground and excited-state methods in NWChem that
    can provide an energy/gradient (analytic or numerical). It can also
    be combined with COSMO. A qmd\_analysis standalone code is also
    provided to analyze the trajectory data.

    [COSMO](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:COSMO_Solvation_Model)
    (keywords to invoke the Klamt-Schuurmann approach is included in the
    documentation). With the extensive changes that were made in the
    COSMO module, the Klamt-Schuurman approach is not perfectly backward
    compatible with the previous 6.5 release. Some cases show small
    differences in the energies. We are working on a patch for backward
    compatibility.
  - Improvements in the
    [NWXC](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:Density_Functional_Theory_for_Molecules#NWXC_--_higher_order_derivatives_for_density_functionals)
    module (experimental)
  - Integration of FEFF6 library into AIMD (FEFF is an automated program
    for ab initio multiple scattering calculations of X-ray Absorption
    Fine Structure (XAFS), X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES)
    and various other spectra for clusters of atoms developed at the
    University of Washington (John Rehr's group)
    <http://feffproject.org/> ).
  - New implementation of the PAW method into PSPW. Simple to use, just
    include PAW potential library in the PSPW simulation.
  - Grimme2, and Grimme3 potentials added to NWPW
  - MGGA-MVS Exchange functional added to [gaussian DFT
    module](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:Density_Functional_Theory_for_Molecules#Exchange-Correlation_Functionals)
  - Initial convergence of NWPW wavefunctions now done using finer grids
    in successive stages.
  - Reading and writing of NWPW wavefunctions in ASCII format. To use
    just append .ascii to the NWPW vectors filename
  - Metropolis NVT and NPT added to PSPW
  - Equation parser for defining collective variables in Metadynamics
    and TAMD
  - New NEB solver based on Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) solver.
    Currently only available on Bitbucket
    (https://bitbucket.org/ebylaska/python-neb.git). Integrated version
    will be available soon in the development tree.
  - Parallel in time integrator for use with NWChem. Python programs
    available at
    <ftp://ftp.aip.org/epaps/journ_chem_phys/E-JCPSA6-139-011332/>
  - Trajectories from the NWChem molecular dynamics module can be
    exported in the xyz format
  - Intel Xeon Phi port for
    [MR-CCSD(T)](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:TCE#CCSD.28T.29_and_MRCCSD.28T.29_implementations_for_Intel_MIC_architectures)
  - The supported version of the Global Arrays library is now
    [5-4](http://hpc.pnl.gov/globalarrays/release_notes.shtml#5.4b)
  - New ARMCI\_NETWORK=MPI-PR (MPI progress ranks). It is the
    recommended option (performance-wise) when no other native ports are
    available.
  - Streamlined installation (automated detection of MPI variables)
  - Improved ScaLapack and ELPA integration. The current ELPA interface
    is compatible with the 2015.05 release.
  - Improved parallelization in DFT [Charge-Density
    fitting](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:Density_Functional_Theory_for_Molecules#Specification_of_Basis_Sets_for_the_DFT_Module)
    (removed semi-direct option)
  - Improved parallel scalability of [Semi-direct
    MP2](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:MP2)
  - Improved stability of in-core installation (e.g. `USE_NOIO=y`) of
    [Semi-direct MP2](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:MP2)
  - Improvements in Xeon Phi offloading for single reference \[Intel
    Xeon Phi port for
    [MR-CCSD(T)](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:TCE#CCSD.28T.29_and_MRCCSD.28T.29_implementations_for_Intel_MIC_architectures)

### NWChem among 13 science projects selected to run on the 300-petaFLOPS Summit

In preparation for next-generation supercomputer Summit, the Oak Ridge
Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) selected 13 partnership projects
into its Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR) program. A
collaborative effort of application development teams and staff from the
OLCF Scientific Computing group, CAAR is focused on redesigning,
porting, and optimizing application codes for Summit’s hybrid CPU–GPU
architecture. Researchers from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and
IBM Almaden Research Center aim to scale the NWChem application to
utilize GPU accelerators to provide benchmark energies to allow for
accurate parameterization of force fields for glycans as well as develop
and disseminate an open-source database of accurate glycan
conformational energies. New implementations of high-accuracy methods
capable of taking advantage of Summit computational resources will
significantly shift the system-size limit tractable by very accurate yet
expensive methods accounting for the inter-electron correlation effects.
<https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/caar/>

### NWChem Tutorial at NSCCS

Two day workshop (April 21st-22nd 2015) will introduce researchers in
the field of computational chemistry to the NWChem software package.
NWChem aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that
can handle (bio)molecules, nanostructures, and solid-state from quantum
to classical, and all combinations thereof.
<http://www.nsccs.ac.uk/NWChem2015.php>

### EMSL Named an Intel Parallel Computing Center

Intel has named EMSL, located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
as an Intel Parallel Computing Center. As an Intel PCC, EMSL’s
scientific computing team will work with Intel to modernize the codes of
NWChem to take advantage of technological advancements in computers.

### NWChem SC2014 paper

![Pic1\_sc2014.png](Pic1_sc2014.png) This paper
presents the implementation and performance of the highly accurate
CCSD(T) quantum chemistry method on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor
within the context of the NWChem computational chemistry package. The
widespread use of highly correlated methods in electronic structure
calculations is contingent upon the interplay between advances in theory
and the possibility of utilizing the ever-growing computer power of
emerging heterogeneous architectures. We discuss the design decisions of
our implementation as well as the optimizations applied to the compute
kernels and data transfers between host and coprocessor. We show the
feasibility of adopting the Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture and
the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor for developing efficient computational
chemistry modeling tools. Remarkable scalability is demonstrated by
benchmarks. Our solution scales up to a total of 62560 cores with the
concurrent utilization of Intel Xeon processors and Intel Xeon Phi
coprocessors. New CCSD(T) implementation is available in the 6.5 release
of NWchem

fixes. As of yet we have not branched the release. The plan is to
stabilize the current development and branch the release later (end of
August/beginning of September). This avoids duplication of work and
checking fixes in in two places (the development branch and the release
branch) as well as weird inconsistencies that may arise from forgotten
checkins.
